# Dynamic App Icons in iOS: A Comprehensive Guide

**Reading Time:** 4 min

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement dynamic app icons in your iOS application using Swift. Dynamic app icons allow users to customize their app experience by switching between multiple icons based on personal preferences, themes, or special events.

## Requirements

To follow this guide, ensure you have the following:

- **Xcode:** Version 11 or later
- **iOS Target:** 10.3 or later
- **App Icons:** Prepare app icons in the appropriate sizes (120px and 180px)

## Steps

1. **Prepare Your App Icons:** Generate required app icons with the naming convention `IconName@2x` for 120px icons and `IconName@3x` for 180px icons.
   
2. **Add Icons to Your Project:** Create a subfolder in your Xcode project to store the icons and add them to your asset catalog.

3. **Update Info.plist:** Register your icon names under the `CFBundleAlternateIcons` key in the `Info.plist` file.

4. **Implement the AppIconManager:** Create a class to manage the dynamic setting of app icons.

5. **Create the Icon List View:** Build a view controller to display available icons, allowing users to select their desired icon.

6. **Testing:** Run your app on a physical device to test the dynamic icon functionality.

## Conclusion

Implementing dynamic app icons enhances user engagement and allows for greater customization. By following this guide, you can easily incorporate this feature into your iOS application.
